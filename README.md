# more-origins-for-the-origins-mod
This page has some Origins that I created for the Minecraft Origins mod.

This page currently includes 1 Origin made by me!

Name: Castkin

Description: Sons and daughters of the elements.

Powers:

Gift of the Winds: Launches the player up in the air.

Winged: The player starts with elytra wings.

Featherweight: The player floats down to the ground as if they were as light as a feather.

Fresh Air: You need to sleep at an altitude of atleast 86 blocks.

Vegetarian: The player can't digest any type of meat.

Sunny Buff: The player layer gets strength 1 while in the sun

Rainy Buff: The player gets speed 2 while getting soaked by the rain.

That is my Origin that I have done so far. If you have any ideas for a new Origin, DM me on Discord, KrusticKrispix#7640 is my Discord.
